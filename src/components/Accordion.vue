                        Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset or basket of assets. One example of a stablecoin built on the Algorand blockchain is the USDC stablecoin.
                    </p><p>

                        Algorand is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform designed to deliver fast, secure, and scalable transactions. The platform uses a consensus mechanism called Pure Proof of Stake, which ensures fast and efficient transaction processing while maintaining a high level of security.
                        </p><p>
                        The USDC stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar. This stability is achieved by holding a reserve of US dollars in proportion to the amount of USDC in circulation. The USDC stablecoin is fully collateralized, meaning that every USDC in circulation is backed by a corresponding US dollar held in reserve.
                        </p><p>
                        The USDC stablecoin can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Because it is pegged to the US dollar, it is less volatile than other cryptocurrencies and is suitable for use in a wider range of financial applications.
                        </p><p>
                        In addition to its stability, the USDC stablecoin also offers a number of other advantages over traditional fiat currencies. For example, it is borderless and can be used for transactions anywhere in the world, it is transparent and the supply is publicly auditable, and it offers faster and more efficient transactions compared to traditional financial systems.
                        </p><p>
                        The USDC stablecoin is also designed to be highly secure, leveraging the security features of the Algorand blockchain. Transactions on the Algorand blockchain are confirmed quickly and efficiently, reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation. The platform is also designed to be resistant to hacking and other forms of cyber attacks, making it a secure choice for storing and using value.
                        </p><p>
                        In conclusion, the USDC stablecoin is a stable, secure, and efficient alternative to traditional fiat currencies that is built on the Algorand blockchain. It offers a number of advantages over traditional currencies, including stability, security, and efficiency, and is well-suited for a wide range of financial applications.

                    Why should we use national stablecoins on algorand?

                        <p>National stablecoins are digital currencies that are pegged to a specific national currency, such as the US dollar, euro, or Japanese yen. The use of national stablecoins on the Algorand blockchain can offer a number of benefits for individuals and organizations.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stable Value: National stablecoins maintain a stable value relative to their underlying national currency, which provides a degree of stability and predictability in the digital currency market. This stability can help mitigate the volatility that is commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, making national stablecoins a more reliable form of digital currency.</li>
                            <li>Faster and Cheaper Transactions: Transactions on the Algorand blockchain are processed quickly and efficiently, and with lower fees than traditional financial systems. This makes national stablecoins a more accessible and affordable option for everyday transactions, particularly for those in underbanked or unbanked populations.</li>
                            <li>Increased Financial Inclusion: The use of national stablecoins can help increase financial inclusion by providing access to digital currencies to individuals who may not have access to traditional banking services. This can help to bridge the gap between the formal and informal economies, enabling more people to participate in the global economy.</li>
                            <li>Improved Security: The Algorand blockchain is designed to be highly secure, with a consensus mechanism that ensures the integrity of transactions and prevents fraudulent activity. The use of national stablecoins on this platform provides an additional layer of security compared to traditional fiat currencies.</li>
                            <li>Cross-Border Payments: National stablecoins can facilitate cross-border payments, as they are borderless and can be used anywhere in the world where there is an internet connection. This can help to reduce barriers to cross-border trade and investment, increasing economic growth and development.</li>
                            <li>Increased Transparency: The Algorand blockchain is transparent, with a publicly auditable supply of national stablecoins. This level of transparency can help to increase trust and confidence in the currency, as users can easily verify the supply and distribution of the coins.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In conclusion, the use of national stablecoins on the Algorand blockchain offers a number of benefits, including stability, affordability, increased financial inclusion, improved security, and increased transparency. By leveraging the capabilities of the Algorand platform, national stablecoins can help to bring the benefits of digital currencies to a wider audience and help to drive economic growth and development.</p>

                        Ludovit Scholtz's vision is to do real estates rental income distributed throught the blockchain. Overall winner at Swiss blockchain hackathon with project <a href="https://www.globdrem.com">DREM</a> has started this path. First production side project on this path was the <a href="https://www.vote-coin.com">VoteCoin</a> - standard for decentralized DAO management. This is second side project on this path as real estate project in Europe requires wide range of national stablecoins on the blockchain.
